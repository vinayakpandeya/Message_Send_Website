Web Development Practice: Day 6
Today, I created a messaging website where you can chat with anyone. This website is fully safe and secure, ensuring that your data cannot be accessed by anyone.
Features:
If someone uses abusive language, their details will be immediately visible to you.
You can easily connect with anyone and have the option to block users as per your preference.
I'm really enjoying my web development journey as I continue to learn and grow!
